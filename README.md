# simple-janus-streaming-client
This is a very easy and short example showing a janus webRTC camera streaming.

This is actually a simplified version of the streaming demo page available at https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/streamingtest.html, with two major differencies:
- There's no way to change the streaming source directly on the page. Only the first streaming channel is displayed (this is ok if you just want to stream a single video)
- No graphic special effects or other stuff... the goal of this repo is to make things as simple as possible

This may be helpful to better understand how to use janus.js and his streaming plugin, especially if you dig into janus for the first time.
